# HealthBay Daignosis Application

## About

This web app was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Heroku server. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:

- Diabetes
- Breast Cancer
- Kidney Disease
- Liver Disease
- Brain Stroke

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Diabetes       | Machine Learning Model   | 80.20%   |
| Breast Cancer  | Machine Learning Model   | 98.28%   |
| Heart Disease  | Machine Learning Model   | 83.78%   |
| Kidney Disease | Machine Learning Model   | 82.10%   |
| Brain Stroke   | Machine Learning Model   | 88.65%   |

## NOTE

==> You can access the website live at: https://healthway-daignosis-application.netlify.app/ <br>
==> Python version 3.6.8 was used for the whole project.<br>
==> You can find all the models in [models](https://github.com/rohitsahu70/HEALTHWAY-WEBSITE-NETLIFY-) folder.
